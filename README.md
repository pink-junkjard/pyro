# pyro

Pyro is a library for getting exactly what you need out of Clojure stacktraces. It can be thought of as a "booster pack" for clj-stacktrace, with easy configuration for your project's needs.

## Usage

## Special Thanks

I owe special thanks to the folks at AvisoNovate, whose work was both an
inspiration and a constant reference. Their library, [pretty](https://github.com/AvisoNovate/pretty), was
what set me down this path in the first place.

Also thanks to [clj-stacktrace](https://github.com/mmcgrana/clj-stacktrace).
